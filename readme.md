    grunt

Booya!

##Quick Start

The main method you will be dealing with is `register`. It's basic signature is as follows:

```javascript
enquire.register(query /* string */, handler /* object || array  || function */);
```

`query` is the CSS media query you wish to respond to, and `handler` is an object containing any logic to handle the query. An example of usage is as follows:

```javascript
enquire.register("screen and (max-width:1000px)", {

    match : function() {},      // OPTIONAL
                                // If supplied, triggered when the media query transitions 
                                // *from an unmatched to a matched state*

    unmatch : function() {},    // OPTIONAL
                                // If supplied, triggered when the media query transitions 
                                // *from a matched state to an unmatched state*.
                                // Also may be called when handler is unregistered (if destroy is not available)

    setup : function() {},      // OPTIONAL
                                // If supplied, triggered once immediately upon registration of the handler

    destroy : function() {},    // OPTIONAL
                                // If supplied, triggered when handler is unregistered. Place cleanup code here

    deferSetup : true           // OPTIONAL, defaults to false
                                // If set to true, defers execution the setup function 
                                // until the media query is first matched. still triggered just once
});
```

This should be enough to get you going, but **please read the full [enquire.js documentation](http://wickynilliams.github.com/enquire.js/)** if you wish to learn about the other cool features.

* Got an awesome idea? 
* Found a *not-so*-awesome bug? 
* Wish to get my attention through an inappropriate communication channel?!

Then please don't hesitate to raise an issue, they will *all* be looked at and tended to.

And for all the cool cats who are prepared to give their time to contribute code, feel free to open a pull request. If you could write unit tests to accompany your pull request that would be pretty sweet, but no worries if not - if it's good enough to be merged in, it's good enough for me to spend a little time to write tests on your behalf :-)
